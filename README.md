 Hi, I'm Bastian, dad, hobby photographer, software developer, and signal processing scientist in Germany.

Both photography and programming are about telling stories. Expressing a complex algorithm in simple terms, or stunning vista in a compelling picture. Finding order and simplicity in a chaotic scene or code base. Therein lies the challenge and joy of life.
